lua-utf8
========

This "library" is meant to be a very thin helper that you can easily drop in to another project without really calling it a dependency.  It aims to provide the most minimal of handling functions for working with utf8 strings.  It does not aim to be feature-complete or even error-descriptive.  It works for what is practical but not complex.  You have been warned. =^__^=
